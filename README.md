# General-Class-Projects

This will be an ongoing collection of partial/micro programs that fulfill a specific purpose or understanding.
Projects that seem viable for expansion will grow into new repositories of their own.

This repo should be used as an educational tool to determine the variety of topics handled at the college level to give an indication of what to learn next.
By no means does it suggest that it will teach what to do, verify the next step in your career, or act as a definite guide to success in the programming industry.
